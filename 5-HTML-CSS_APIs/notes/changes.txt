New Page: api-page.html:

Purpose: A new page was created to demonstrate API interactions and form validation.
Content:
Sections for interacting with NASAâ€™s APOD API, Datamuse API, and a form validation example.
Each section contains buttons and input fields for user interaction.
JavaScript File: api-script.js:

Purpose: A new JavaScript file was created to handle API calls and form validation.
Functionality Added:
NASA APOD API Integration:
Fetches and displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day.
Uses Promises (then/catch) to handle the API call and display the data (image, title, date, explanation).
Datamuse API Integration:
Fetches word suggestions based on user input.
Utilizes async/await for the API call.
Displays the suggestions in a list format on the page.
Form Validation:
Implemented a form with fields for email, phone number, and ZIP code.
Applied HTML5 validation attributes (required, pattern, maxlength, etc.) to enforce proper input formatting.
Used JavaScript to handle the form submission, prevent the default behavior, and display a success message when the form is correctly filled out.
Program Structure:

HTML Structure:
api-page.html: Contains sections dedicated to API interactions and form validation.
Navigation: Links were added to the navigation menu to access the new api-page.html from the home page.
JavaScript:
api-script.js: Includes all the logic for fetching data from the APIs and handling form validation. This script is linked to api-page.html.
User Interface Enhancements:

Dynamic Content: The API data is dynamically inserted into the HTML, providing an interactive experience for users.
Validation Feedback: Real-time feedback is provided to users when interacting with the form, ensuring inputs are valid before submission.
