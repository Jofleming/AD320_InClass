New Page: message-board.html

Purpose: Created a new page for a message board that allows users to log in, post messages, and view messages.
Content:
Login Section: Includes an input field for the username and buttons for login and logout.
Message Board: Contains a text area for users to type their messages and a section to display posted messages.
JavaScript File: message-board.js

Purpose: This script handles the login/logout functionality, manages session data using cookies, and stores messages in localStorage.
Key Functionalities Implemented:

Login and Logout:
Login: When a user logs in by entering their username, a session cookie named sessionUser is created to store the username.
Logout: The logout functionality clears the session cookie, hides the message board, and shows the login section again.
Message Posting:
Users can post messages to the message board. These messages are stored in localStorage so that they persist across sessions.
Messages are displayed on the message board along with the username of the poster.
Data Storage and Retrieval:
Cookies: Used to store the logged-in user's username (sessionUser).
localStorage: Used to store messages, ensuring they persist between browser sessions.
sessionStorage: Not used in the current implementation, but it could be leveraged for storing session-specific data if needed.
Functions:
setCookie(name, value, hours): Sets a cookie with the specified name, value, and expiration time.
getCookie(name): Retrieves the value of the specified cookie.
deleteCookie(name): Deletes the specified cookie.
getStoredMessages(): Retrieves messages from localStorage.
displayMessages(messages): Renders messages on the message board.
Navigation Update in index.html

Purpose: Added a link to the new message-board.html page in the site's navigation menu.
Navigation Item: A new item labeled "Message Board" was added to the navigation menu, allowing users to easily access the message board from the home page.
Debugging and Fixes:

Username Display Issue: Addressed an issue where messages were being posted with "null" as the username. Ensured that the sessionUser is correctly retrieved before posting a message, so that the correct username is displayed.
Cookie Management: Implemented functions to correctly manage cookies, ensuring that the login status persists across page reloads and sessions.
