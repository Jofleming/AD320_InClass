avaScript Enhancements and New Features:
Asynchronous Programming:

Promises with then and catch:

Implemented a function (fetchDataWithPromises) to fetch data from an API using Promises.
Error handling was managed using then and catch methods.
Async and Await:

A second function (fetchDataWithAsync) was created using async and await to perform the same data fetching operation, providing a cleaner and more modern syntax.
This function also included error handling using try/catch.
Fetch Command with a JavaScript Object:

Implemented a sendData function that sends a JavaScript object to an API using the fetch method with the POST method.
The response from the server was handled and displayed in the console or on the page.
Interactivity Enhancements:

Button to Toggle Slideshow:

Added a button that allows users to show or hide the slideshow on the page.
When hidden, the slideshow stops running; when shown again, the slideshow resumes.
Display of Fetched Data:

Data fetched from the API using the fetchDataWithPromises or fetchDataWithAsync functions was displayed dynamically on the page.
Error Handling for Slideshow:

Fixed issues related to the slideshowInterval by correctly initializing and clearing the interval when the slideshow is toggled on or off.
Troubleshooting and Debugging:

Null Check for Slideshow Section:
Added checks to ensure the slideshow section exists before manipulating it, preventing potential errors in the script.
Button Click Debugging:
Verified that the "Send Data" button correctly triggers the sendData function, with troubleshooting steps provided to ensure the function is called as expected.
UI Enhancements:

User Feedback on Data Sending:
Modified the sendData function to display feedback directly on the page, showing whether data was successfully sent or if an error occurred.
