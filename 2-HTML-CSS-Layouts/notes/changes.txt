Explanation of Changes:
Navigation (nav ul):

Implemented Flexbox to horizontally align the navigation links and center them. This makes the navigation more responsive and cleaner.
About Page (#about):

Used CSS Grid to create a two-column layout where the image is in one column and the details in another. This layout is easy to adapt for different screen sizes and ensures that content is well-organized.
Projects Page (#projects):

Introduced CSS Grid with repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)) to create a responsive grid that adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size. Each project is neatly aligned and spaced.
Contact Page (#contact):

Used Flexbox for the contact form layout, centering the form and its elements. This approach simplifies vertical alignment and responsiveness.


Grid Layout (.intro-grid):

The introduction section is divided into two columns using CSS Grid, with equal width (1fr 1fr).
The first column contains an image (which you can replace with any tech-related image).
The second column contains a short paragraph that describes your passion for web development.
Flexbox for Centering Content (.intro-text):

The text in the right column is centered vertically and horizontally using Flexbox within the .intro-text container.
This ensures the paragraph is neatly positioned within its space and maintains good readability.
Styling Enhancements:

The image is styled with a border-radius and box-shadow to make it visually appealing.
The text container also has a background color, border-radius, and box-shadow to match the overall aesthetic.
